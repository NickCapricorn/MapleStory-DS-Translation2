Hello Adventurer, Welcome[\n]to the World of MapleStory.[\n]My name is Minerva,[\n]The gate guardian of Maple World.[\n]
Before we begin[\n]you’ll have to pick a class.[\n]Each class has a different story[\n]that will tie in with the others.[\n]
Warrior or Thief[\n]are your current choices. Unlock others[\n]when you complete these adventures.[\n]
With that in mind,[\n]which class will you start with?[\n] [\n]Warrior[\n] Thief
Once you finish this adventure[\n] You can start a new adventure[\n] as one of the other three.
Is this the class you[\n]want to start with?[\n] [\n]  Yes [\n]  No
No? Let’s go back,[\n]so you can pick the other.
Choose a name you’d like to use[\n] while adventuring through MapleStory.

Excellent![\n]I hope you enjoy the adventures[\n] MapleStory has to offer.[\n]
One last thing before you go,[\n]to identify the save file[\n]I need your signature.
